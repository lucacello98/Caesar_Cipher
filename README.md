Description:
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. This Python project allows users to either encrypt (encode) or decrypt a message using this cipher.

Features:
Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
Allows the user to choose the direction (encode or decode) and the shift amount.
The program handles both alphabetic characters and non-alphabetic characters.
The program continues to run, allowing the user to encode/decode multiple messages until they choose to exit.

How to Use:
Run the Python script.
You will be prompted to:
Choose whether to encode or decode the message.
Enter the message you wish to encode or decode.
Enter the shift number (how many positions each letter should be shifted).
The result will be displayed, and you will be asked if you want to perform another operation.
Type "yes" to continue or "no" to exit.
